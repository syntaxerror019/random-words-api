## Note: This project is now hosted on repl.it, as vercel's serverless websites caused probkems with some programming languages. Please use the Repl version of Random-Word-Api. Thanks!



# Random Word API

This is an API that can be used to find random words and their definitions. You can specify different parameters to customize the response in order to suit the needs of your project.

## How to use it

Visit the main page of the website [here](https://rando-word-api.vercel.app/) and check out the endpoints supported.


## Notes

You may call the API 30 times per minute, or you will get rate-limited. If you need a higher quota, reach out to me with your specific scenario or deploy this API locally and remove the rate-limiting functionality from the code.

## Running Locally

```bash
npm i -g vercel
vercel dev
```

Your Flask application is now available at `http://localhost:3000`.
