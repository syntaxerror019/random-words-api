## How to use it

Visit the main page of the website [here](https://rando-word-api.vercel.app/) and check out the endpoints supported.


## Notes

You may call the API 30 times per minute, or you will get rate-limited. If you need a higher quota, reach out to me with your specific scenario or deploy this API locally and remove the rate-limiting functionality from the code.

## Running Locally

```bash
npm i -g vercel
vercel dev
```

Your Flask application is now available at `http://localhost:3000`.
